After a player receives a ",Object(n.b)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Fix Clue")," in such a situation, they should assume that the ",Object(n.b)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Finesse"),' is "still on". So, depending on the situation, they should either know that the initial card that was clued is playable (like in an ',Object(n.b)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Out-of-Order Finesse"),") or continue to blind-play cards to fulfill the initial ",Object(n.b)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Finesse")," (if the card clued with a ",Object(n.b)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Fix Clue")," seems to be unrelated)."),Object(n.b)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Importantly, ",Object(n.b)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Finesses")," with a ",Object(n.b)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Lie Component")," are ",Object(n.b)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"only"),' allowed if there is not an alternative line that would "get" the same number of cards without any lies. Thus, if you are looking to do a ',Object(n.b)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Finesse")," with a ",Object(n.b)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Lie Component"),", make sure you carefully consider the efficiency of all of the possible alternatives.")))}c.isMDXComponent=!0},167:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"a",(function(){return h})),a.d(t,"b",(function(){return u}));var l=a(0),i=a.n(l);function n(e,t,a){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:a,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=a,e}function r(e,t){var a=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var l=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(l=l.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),a.push.apply(a,l)}return a}function s(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var a=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?r(Object(a),!0).forEach((function(t){n(e,t,a[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(a)):r(Object(a)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(a,t))}))}return e}function o(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,l,i=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,l,i={},n=Object.keys(e);for(l=0;l<n.length;l++)a=n[l],t.indexOf(a)>=0||(i[a]=e[a]);return i}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var n=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(l=0;l<n.length;l++)a=n[l],t.indexOf(a)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,a)&&(i[a]=e[a])}return i}var b=i.a.createContext({}),c=function(e){var t=i.a.useContext(b),a=t;return e&&(a="function"==typeof e?e(t):s(s({},t),e)),a},h=function(e){var t=c(e.components);return i.a.createElement(b.Provider,{value:t},e.children)},m={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,{},t)}},p=i.a.forwardRef((function(e,t){var a=e.components,l=e.mdxType,n=e.originalType,r=e.parentName,b=o(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),h=c(a),p=l,u=h["".concat(r,".").concat(p)]||h[p]||m[p]||n;return a?i.a.createElement(u,s(s({ref:t},b),{},{components:a})):i.a.createElement(u,s({ref:t},b))}));function u(e,t){var a=arguments,l=t&&t.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||l){var n=a.length,r=new Array(n);r[0]=p;var s={};for(var o in t)hasOwnProperty.call(t,o)&&(s[o]=t[o]);s.originalType=e,s.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:l,r[1]=s;for(var b=2;b<n;b++)r[b]=a[b];return i.a.createElement.apply(null,r)}return i.a.createElement.apply(null,a)}p.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
